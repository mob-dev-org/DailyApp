to ask user if he want to remove that task,
same thing goes for when user click on "BIN" icon next to "TASK LIST" it should display dialog box 
to ask user if he want to remove all

-edit tasks, when user click on EDIT button it should show two new buttons, SAVE(will take place of DEL ) and 
CANCEL(will take place of EDIT),
SAVE button should save edited text, and CANCEL should stop editing poroces
Editing proces will start in task input field,


-check if task is done, checkbox will be displayed on every task so user should be able to mark that task as "DONE",
-when user mark task done text of task will be crossed out, and EDIT button will disappear
